## Machine Learning Overview Guide

### What is Machine Learning?
Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and make decisions from data without being explicitly programmed for every task.

### Key Types of Machine Learning
- **Supervised Learning**: Learning with labeled data (classification, regression)
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Finding patterns in unlabeled data (clustering, dimensionality reduction)
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Learning through interaction and feedback
