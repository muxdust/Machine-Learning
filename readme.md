# Machine Learning Journey

## Overview

Welcome to my machine learning journey! This repository documents my progress, projects, and learnings in the field of machine learning.

## Machine Learning Overview Guide

### What is Machine Learning?

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and make decisions from data without being explicitly programmed for every task.

### Key Types of Machine Learning

- **Supervised Learning**: Learning with labeled data (classification, regression)
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Finding patterns in unlabeled data (clustering, dimensionality reduction)
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Learning through interaction and feedback

### Supervised Learning - Regression Projects

#### Available Implementations

- **Linear Regression** (`linear.ipynb`) - Basic linear relationship modeling
- **Polynomial Regression** (`polynomial.ipynb`) - Non-linear relationship modeling
- **Ridge Regression** (`ridge.ipynb`) - L2 regularization technique
- **Lasso Regression** (`lasso.ipynb`) - L1 regularization with feature selection
- **Elastic Net** (`elasticnet.ipynb`) - Combined L1 and L2 regularization
- **Decision Tree Regression** (`desctree.ipynb`) - Tree-based regression model
- **Random Forest Regression** (`randforest.ipynb`) - Ensemble of decision trees
- **K-Nearest Neighbors** (`knn.ipynb`) - Distance-based regression model

#### Dataset

- `dataset.csv` - Training data for regression experiments
- `requirements.txt` - Required Python packages for running the notebooks
